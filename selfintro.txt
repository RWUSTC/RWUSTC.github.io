                        <font color="black"><p>My name is Hefeng Xu (徐鹤峰), an undergraduate student in <a href="https://ustc.edu.cn" style="text-decoration:none">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a>. I was admitted to College of Physics, USTC in the summer of 2019 and developed my interest in Mathematics and Fundamental Physics in the past few years. Now I major in Theoretical Physics and receiving R&D training in <a href="https://icts.ustc.edu.cn" style="text-decoration:none">Interdisciplinary Center for Theoretical Study (ICTS)</a> as a cadet. My current advisor is <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yzhphy/index.html" style="text-decoration:none">Prof. Yang Zhang</a>.</p></font>
                        <font color="black"><p>My interest in research lies majorly the geometric and algebraic structures in high-energy physics, such as some algebraic geometric methods in the problem of calculating Feynman Integrals. Currently, I'm doing some numerical computation and reduction of polynomials under the supervision of my advisor. But I'm seeking some more abstract and fundamental topics to look into, for example, it can be very interesting to think about something in the noncommutative geometric structure of the supersymmetry group of D-brane and the status of p-adic metric in quantum field theory, etc.</p></font>
                        <font color="black"><p>I'm now struggling to learn some ideas in Quantum Field Theory, Gauge Theory, Algebriac Geometry, Noncommutative Geometry and Elementary Differential Topology, together with great interest in Topos Theory. I'm very glad to have some open discussions in the fields above. If you are reading Peskin's <i>An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory</i>, Grothedieck's Ideas in AG (e.g, EGA, FGA, etc), Categories and Topos, we can elaborate some reading groups of the specific books or mini-workshops on this topics.</p></font>
                        <font color="black"><p>We can talk about mathematics and physics in Mandarin, French, English and Japanese.</p></font>
                        <font color="black"><p>My home is in a small town named Xinyang in Henan Province, China. But I don't like it very much. Maybe I was born to be a traveler to embrace the environment. In my free time, I prefer to go running, do some photographing, modeling and research in to law enforcements. We can also communicate on these topics.</p></font>
